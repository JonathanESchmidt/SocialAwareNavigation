# SocialAwareNavigation

This project implements Social Aware Navigation using ROS.
The setup can be used with different mobile platforms but has been tested with a MiR100 platform.
Additionally, the system has been simulated with a Neobotix mp655 platform and can therefore also be implemented on one of those.
Furthermore, the modules can be adapted to be used with different platforms.

## Repository

The system consists of two different modules that are created in different workspaces. One workspace is for controlling the platform - this is called 'Workspace'. The other is called 'JetsonWorkspace' and is run on a jetson nano which is connected to a realsense D435 to use for people detection and localisation.
